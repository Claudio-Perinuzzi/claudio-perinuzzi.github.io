# About Me

Welcome! I am Claudio Perinuzzi, a BA computer science senior at CUNY Queens College, with a background in biology from my time as a BS major at Stony Brook University. Currently, I work as a Data Manager at a small but mighty medical office. I believe my diverse background between technology and the life sciences offers a unique perspective to solving complicated problems. I am eager to expand my skill set and contribute to innovative, yet simple solutions!

## Fun Fact!

I've became a second-degree instructor in 2018 at the Chinese Kung-Fu Wu-Su Association, a non-profit organization in New York dedicated to preserving and teaching a traditional system of Chinese martial arts that predates the modern codification of this art. I owe a great deal of respect to this practice, as it has guided me through various tribulations in life and continues to be a source of strength and resilience for me.
