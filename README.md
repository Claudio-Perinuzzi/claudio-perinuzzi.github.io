# About Me

Welcome! I am Claudio Perinuzzi, a BA computer science senior at CUNY Queens College, with a background in biology from my time as a BS major at Stony Brook University. Currently, I work as a Data Manager at a small but mighty medical office. I believe my diverse background between technology and the life sciences offers a unique perspective to solving complicated problems. I am eager to expand my skill set and contribute to innovative, yet simple solutions.
